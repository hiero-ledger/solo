/**
 * @description Thrown when solo reads its local configuration but no file exists at the
 * resolved path (`~/.solo/local-config.yaml`, or `$SOLO_HOME/local-config.yaml` when
 * `SOLO_HOME` is set). The local config records cluster references, deployments, and the
 * active user context, so most commands load it before doing any work. The file is missing
 * because `solo init` has not yet run on this machine, because `SOLO_HOME` points at a
 * different directory than the one the file was created in, or because it was manually moved
 * or deleted.
