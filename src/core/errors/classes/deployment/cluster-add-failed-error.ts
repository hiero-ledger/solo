/**
 * @description Thrown when attaching a cluster to a deployment fails; the underlying failure is
 * wrapped in `cause`. Attaching binds a registered cluster reference (and its kubeconfig
 * context) to the deployment so components can be placed there, so this is raised when that step
 * cannot complete — commonly because the cluster reference has not been created/connected yet,
 * the kubeconfig context does not exist, or the cluster is unreachable. It is retryable, since a
 * transient connectivity issue often clears once the reference and context are valid.
