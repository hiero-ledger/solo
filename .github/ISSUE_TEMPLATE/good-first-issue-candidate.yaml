        ## Thanks for submitting a Good First Issue!
        
        This issue targets first time contributors to [Hiero](https://hiero.org).
        We know that creating a pull request (PR) is a major barrier for new contributors.
        The goal of this issue (and all other issues labeled with) [**'Good First Issue'**](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+org%3Ahiero-ledger+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+) is to help you make your first contribution to Hiero.

        Before submitting:
        * Try searching the existing issues and discussions to see if something similar has been discussed previously.
        * Try opening a GitHub discussion first to gather feedback and reach consensus.
        * If this is a major enhancement, please open a [Hiero Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals).
