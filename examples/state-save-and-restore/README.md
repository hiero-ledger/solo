# State Save and Restore Example

This example demonstrates how to save network state from a running Solo network, recreate a new network, and load the saved state with a mirror node using an external PostgreSQL database.

## What it does

* Creates an initial Solo network with consensus nodes and mirror node
* Uses an external PostgreSQL database for the mirror node
* Runs transactions to generate state
* Downloads and saves the network state and database dump
* Destroys the initial network
* Creates a new network with the same configuration
* Restores the saved state and database to the new network

## Prerequisites

* [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) - Kubernetes in Docker
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) - Kubernetes CLI
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
* [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) - Task runner
* [Helm](https://helm.sh/) - Kubernetes package manager (for external database option)

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Workflow (One Command)

```bash
task               # Run entire workflow: setup → save → restore
task destroy       # Cleanup when done
```

### Step-by-Step Workflow

```bash
task setup          # 1. Deploy network with external database (5-10 min)
task save-state     # 2. Save state and database (2-5 min)
task restore        # 3. Recreate and restore (3-5 min)
task status         # 4. Check status
task destroy        # 5. Cleanup
```

## Usage

### 1. Deploy Initial Network

```sh
task setup
```

This will:
* Create a Kind cluster
* Deploy PostgreSQL database
* Initialize Solo
* Deploy consensus network with 3 nodes
* Deploy mirror node connected to external database
* Run sample transactions to generate state

### 2. Save Network State and Database

```sh
task save-state
```

This will:
* Download state from all consensus nodes
* Export PostgreSQL database dump
* Save both to `./saved-states/` directory
* Display saved state information

### 3. Restore Network and Database

```sh
task restore
```

This will:
* Stop and destroy existing network
* Recreate PostgreSQL database
* Import database dump
* Create new consensus network with same configuration
* Upload saved state to new nodes
* Start nodes with restored state
* Reconnect mirror node to database
* Verify the restored state

### 4. Cleanup

```sh
task destroy
```

This will delete the Kind cluster and clean up all resources.

## Available Tasks

* `default` (or just `task`) - Run complete workflow: setup → save-state → restore
* `setup` - Deploy initial network with external PostgreSQL database
* `save-state` - Download consensus node state and export database
* `restore` - Recreate network and restore state with database
* `status` - Show network and state status
* `verify-state` - Verify restored state matches original
* `destroy` - Delete cluster and clean up all resources
* `clean-state` - Remove saved state files

## Customization

You can adjust settings by editing the `vars:` section in `Taskfile.yml`:

* `NETWORK_SIZE` - Number of consensus nodes (default: 2)
* `NODE_ALIASES` - Node identifiers (default: node1,node2)
* `STATE_SAVE_DIR` - Directory to save state files (default: ./saved-states)
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password for external database

## State Files

Saved state files are stored in `./saved-states/` with the following structure:

```
saved-states/
├── network-node1-0-state.zip  # Used for all nodes during restore
├── network-node2-0-state.zip  # Downloaded but not used during restore
└── database-dump.sql          # PostgreSQL database export
```

**Notes:**
- State files are named using the pod naming convention: `network-<node-alias>-0-state.zip`
- During save: All node state files are downloaded
- During restore: Only the first node's state file is used for all nodes (for simplicity)

The example also includes:

```
scripts/
└── init.sh                 # Database initialization script
```

The `init.sh` script sets up the PostgreSQL database with:
* mirror_node database
* Required schemas (public, temporary)
* Roles and users (postgres, readonlyuser)
* PostgreSQL extensions (btree_gist, pg_stat_statements, pg_trgm)
* Proper permissions and grants

## How It Works

### State Saving Process

1. **Download State**: Uses `solo consensus state download` to download signed state from each consensus node to `~/.solo/logs/<namespace>/`
2. **Copy State Files**: Copies state files from `~/.solo/logs/<namespace>/` to `./saved-states/` directory
3. **Export Database**: Uses `pg_dump` with `--clean --if-exists` flags to export the complete database including schema and data

### State Restoration Process

1. **Database Recreation**: Deploys fresh PostgreSQL and runs `init.sh` to create database structure (database, schemas, roles, users, extensions)
2. **Database Restore**: Imports database dump which drops and recreates tables with all data
3. **Network Recreation**: Creates new network with identical configuration
4. **State Upload**: Uploads the first node's saved state file to all consensus nodes using `solo consensus node start --state-file`
   - Note: For simplicity, all nodes use the same state file from the first node
5. **Mirror Node**: Deploys mirror node connected to restored database and seeds initial data
6. **Verification**: Checks that restored state matches original

## Notes

* State files can be large (several GB per node) depending on network activity
* Ensure sufficient disk space in `./saved-states/` directory
* External PostgreSQL database provides data persistence and queryability
* State restoration maintains transaction history and account balances
* Mirror node will resume from the restored state point
* Database dump includes all mirror node data (transactions, accounts, etc.)

## Useful Commands

### Check Status
```bash
task status
```

### View Logs
```bash
# Consensus node logs
kubectl logs -n state-restore-namespace network-node1-0 -f

# Mirror node logs
kubectl logs -n state-restore-namespace mirror-node-<pod-name> -f

# Database logs
kubectl logs -n database state-restore-postgresql-0 -f
```

### Manual State Operations
```bash
# Download state manually
npm run solo --silent -- consensus state download --deployment state-restore-deployment --node-aliases node1

# Check downloaded state files (in Solo logs directory)
ls -lh ~/.solo/logs/state-restore-namespace/

# Check saved state files (in saved-states directory)
ls -lh ./saved-states/
```

## Expected Timeline

* Initial setup: 5-10 minutes
* State download: 2-5 minutes (depends on state size)
* Network restoration: 3-5 minutes
* Total workflow: ~15-20 minutes

## File Sizes

Typical state file sizes:
* Small network (few transactions): 100-500 MB per node
* Medium activity: 1-3 GB per node
* Heavy activity: 5-10+ GB per node

Ensure you have sufficient disk space in `./saved-states/` directory.

## Advanced Usage

### Save State at Specific Time
Run `task save-state` at any point after running transactions. The state captures the network at that moment.

### Restore to Different Cluster
1. Save state on cluster A
2. Copy `./saved-states/` directory to cluster B
3. Run `task restore` on cluster B

### Multiple State Snapshots
```bash
# Save multiple snapshots
task save-state
mv saved-states saved-states-backup1

# Later...
task save-state
mv saved-states saved-states-backup2

# Restore specific snapshot
mv saved-states-backup1 saved-states
task restore
```

## Troubleshooting

**State download fails**:
- Ensure nodes are running and healthy
- Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n <namespace> <pod-name>`
- Increase timeout or download nodes sequentially

**Restore fails**:
- Verify state files exist in `./saved-states/`
- Check file permissions
- Ensure network configuration matches original
- Check state file integrity

**Database connection fails**:
- Verify PostgreSQL pod is ready
- Check credentials in Taskfile.yml
- Review PostgreSQL logs

**Out of disk space**:
- Clean old state files with `task clean-state`
- Check available disk space before saving state

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n state-restore-namespace

# Describe problematic pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n state-restore-namespace

# Get pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n state-restore-namespace

# Access database shell
kubectl exec -it state-restore-postgresql-0 -n database -- psql -U postgres -d mirror_node
```
