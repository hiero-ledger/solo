# Backup and Restore Workflow Example

This example demonstrates a complete backup and restore workflow for a Hiero network using Solo's `config ops backup` and `config ops restore` commands. It shows how to:

1. Deploy a complete network infrastructure (consensus + block + mirror + relay + explorer)
2. Generate transactions to create network state
3. Freeze the network and create a comprehensive backup
4. Destroy the entire cluster
5. Redeploy a fresh network
6. Restore from backup (ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, and State)
7. Verify the restored network is fully operational

## Prerequisites

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) installed (`brew install go-task/tap/go-task` on macOS)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) installed (`brew install kind` on macOS)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- Node.js 20+ and npm installed
- Docker Desktop running with sufficient resources (8GB+ RAM recommended)

## Quick Start

### Run Complete Workflow

Execute the entire backup/restore workflow with a single command:

```bash
task
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a Kind cluster and deploy the complete network
- ✅ Generate test transactions
- ✅ Backup the entire network (ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, State)
- ✅ Destroy the cluster completely
- ✅ Redeploy a fresh network from scratch
- ✅ Restore all components from backup
- ✅ Verify the network is operational with new transactions

### Clean Up

Remove the cluster and all backup files:

```bash
task destroy
```

## Available Tasks

### Main Workflow Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `task` (default) | Run complete backup/restore workflow |
| `task setup` | Deploy complete network infrastructure |
| `task backup` | Freeze network and create backup |
| `task restore` | Restore from backup |
| `task verify` | Verify restored network functionality |
| `task destroy` | Remove cluster and backup files |

### Component Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `task create-cluster` | Create Kind cluster |
| `task init-solo` | Initialize Solo configuration |
| `task deploy-network` | Deploy all network components |
| `task generate-transactions` | Create test transactions |
| `task destroy-cluster` | Delete entire cluster |
| `task redeploy` | Redeploy network after cluster deletion |

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Deploy Initial Network

```bash
task setup
```

This deploys:
- 2 consensus nodes (node1, node2)
- 1 block node
- 1 mirror node
- Relay nodes for each consensus node
- 1 explorer node

### 2. Generate Network State

```bash
task generate-transactions
```

Creates 3 test accounts with 100 HBAR each to generate network state.

### 3. Create Backup

```bash
task backup
```

This will:
- Destroy the mirror node (required before freeze)
- Freeze the network
- Backup ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, and State files using `solo config ops backup`

**Backup Location:**
- All backup files: `./solo-backup/`

### 4. Destroy and Redeploy

```bash
# Destroy cluster
task destroy-cluster

# Redeploy fresh network
task redeploy
```

This simulates a complete disaster recovery scenario.

### 5. Restore from Backup

```bash
task restore
```

This will:
- Stop consensus nodes
- Restore ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, and State files using `solo config ops restore`
- Restart consensus nodes

### 6. Verify Restored Network

```bash
task verify
```

Verifies:
- All pods are running
- Previously created accounts exist (e.g., account 0.0.3)
- Network can process new transactions

## Configuration

Edit variables in `Taskfile.yml` to customize:

```yaml
vars:
  NETWORK_SIZE: "2"              # Number of consensus nodes
  NODE_ALIASES: "node1,node2"    # Node identifiers
  DEPLOYMENT: "backup-restore-deployment"
  NAMESPACE: "backup-restore-namespace"
  CLUSTER_NAME: "backup-restore-cluster"
  BACKUP_DIR: "./solo-backup"    # All backup files location
```

## What Gets Backed Up?

The `solo config ops backup` command backs up:

### ConfigMaps
- Network configuration (`network-node-data-config-cm`)
- Bootstrap properties
- Application properties
- Genesis network configuration
- Address book

### Secrets
- Node keys (TLS, signing, agreement)
- Consensus keys
- All Opaque secrets in the namespace

### Logs (from each pod)
- Account balances
- Record streams
- Statistics
- Application logs
- Network logs

### State Files (from each consensus node)
- Consensus state
- Merkle tree state
- Platform state
- Swirlds state

## Backup Directory Structure

```
solo-backup/
└── kind-backup-restore-cluster/
    ├── configmaps/
    │   ├── network-node-data-config-cm.yaml
    │   └── ...
    ├── secrets/
    │   ├── node1-keys.yaml
    │   └── ...
    └── logs/
        ├── network-node1-0.zip  (includes state files)
        └── network-node2-0.zip  (includes state files)
```

## Troubleshooting

### View Cluster Status

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-backup-restore-cluster
kubectl get pods -n backup-restore-namespace -o wide
```

### View Pod Logs

```bash
kubectl logs -n backup-restore-namespace network-node1-0 -c root-container --tail=100
```

### Open Shell in Pod

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n backup-restore-namespace network-node1-0 -c root-container -- /bin/bash
```

### Manual Cleanup

```bash
# Delete cluster
kind delete cluster -n backup-restore-cluster

# Remove backup files
rm -rf ./solo-backup

# Clean Solo cache
rm -rf ~/.solo/*
```

## Advanced Usage

### Run Individual Steps

```bash
# Deploy network only
task setup

# Generate test data
task generate-transactions

# Create backup
task backup

# Manually inspect backup
ls -lh ./solo-backup/

# Restore whenever ready (nodes must be running first)
task restore

# Verify
task verify
```

### Use Released Version of Solo

By default, the Taskfile uses the development version (`npm run solo-test --`). To use the released version:

```bash
USE_RELEASED_VERSION=true task
```

## Key Commands Used

This example demonstrates the following Solo commands:

- **`solo config ops backup`** - Backs up ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, and State files
- **`solo config ops restore`** - Restores ConfigMaps, Secrets, Logs, and State files
- **`solo consensus network freeze`** - Freezes the network before backup
- **`solo consensus node stop/start`** - Controls node lifecycle during restore

## Important Notes

- The network must be **frozen** before backup to ensure consistent state
- Mirror node must be **destroyed** before freezing the network  
- Backup process can take several minutes depending on state size
- Restore requires nodes to be **stopped** to prevent conflicts
- Backup files can be large - ensure sufficient disk space (1GB+ per node)
