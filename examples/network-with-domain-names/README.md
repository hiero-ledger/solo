# Network with Domain Names Example

This example demonstrates how to deploy a Hiero Hashgraph Solo network with custom domain names for nodes, mirror node, relay, and explorer using Kubernetes and Taskfile.

## What it does
- Creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind
- Deploys a Solo network with a single consensus node, mirror node, relay, explorer, and custom domain names for all services
- Provides tasks to install (start) and destroy the network

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**
   - Make sure you have [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) installed.

2. **Deploy the network**
   ```sh
   task
   ```
   This will:
   - Install the Solo CLI
   - Create a Kind cluster
   - Initialize Solo
   - Connect and set up the cluster reference
   - Create and configure the deployment
   - Generate node keys
   - Deploy the network, node, mirror node, relay, and explorer with custom domain names
   - Set up port forwarding for key services
   - Run a sample SDK connection script

3. **Destroy the network**
   ```sh
   task destroy
   ```
   This will:
   - Stop the node
   - Destroy the mirror node, relay, and explorer
   - Destroy the Solo network
   - Delete the Kind cluster

## Tasks
- `install`: Installs and starts the Solo network with custom domain names for all components, sets up port forwarding, and runs a sample SDK connection.
- `destroy`: Stops and removes all network components and deletes the Kind cluster.

## Customization
You can adjust the domain names and other settings by editing the `vars:` section in the `Taskfile.yaml`.
