# Custom Network Config Example

This example demonstrates how to create and manage a custom Hiero Hashgraph Solo deployment and configure it with custom settings.

## What It Does
- **Defines a custom network topology** (number of nodes, namespaces, deployments, etc.)
- **Provides a Taskfile** for automating cluster creation, deployment, key management, and network operations
- **Supports local development and testing** of Hedera network features
- **Can be extended** to include mirror nodes, explorers, and relays

## How to Use
1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/), and [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) installed.
2. **Customize your network:**
   - Edit `Taskfile.yml` to set the desired network size, namespaces, and other parameters.
3. **Run the default workflow:**
   - From this directory, run:
     ```sh
     task
     ```
   - This will:
     - Install the Solo CLI
     - Create a Kind cluster
     - Set the kubectl context
     - Initialize Solo
     - Connect and set up the cluster reference
     - Create and configure the deployment
     - Add the cluster to the deployment
     - Generate node keys
     - Deploy the network with custom configuration files
     - Set up and start nodes
     - Deploy mirror node, relay, and explorer
4. **Destroy the network:**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     task destroy
     ```
   - This will:
     - Stop all nodes
     - Destroy mirror node, relay, and explorer
     - Destroy the Solo network
     - Delete the Kind cluster

## Files
- `Taskfile.yml` — All automation tasks and configuration
- `init-containers-values.yaml`, `settings.txt`, `log4j2.xml`, `application.properties` — Example config files for customizing your deployment

## Notes
- This example is **self-contained** and does not require files from outside this directory.
- All steps in the workflow are named for clear logging and troubleshooting.
- You can extend the Taskfile to add more custom resources or steps as needed.
- For more advanced usage, see the main [Solo documentation](https://github.com/hashgraph/solo).
